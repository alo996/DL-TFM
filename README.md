# DL-TFM

This project is part of my undergraduate research conducted at the LMU-based ['Cell Biophysics and Statistical Physics' (https://www.biostatphys.vetmed.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) group led by Prof. Dr. Saba√ü. I implemented a neural network to predict traction forces exerted by various cell types, given a displacement field that was aquired via Traction Force Microscopy (TFM). The implementation is largely based on the paper ['Traction force microscopy by deep learning'] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349521004987) by Yu-li Wang and Yun-Chu Lin.

## Coming up

At this point, the predictions generated by the modified U-Net lack a probabilistic view and therefore also notions of (un-) certainty. My bachelor thesis, starting in fall 2022, aims to close this gap by providing an easy-to-use software to predict cellular traction forces while also quantifying the model uncertainty via Bayesian methods. The goal is to create an interpretable and user-friendly tool for experimental biologists to perform TFM.
